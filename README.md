# bug-tracker-BETA

The Ozon OS Beta bug tracker repository.

## Issues

As of the BETA we have not gone in to much fiddling with the OS most technical aspects, thus, if you have problems with the installer which is that of Fedora's or with something else. We'll first check with a Fedora 21 install and see whether it happens there too. 

If it does that's an upstream issue. And it'd be better to report it to Fedora directly.
If it doesn't happen on Fedora then it's an issue caused by us and we'll attempt to fix it.
